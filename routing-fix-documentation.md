# Root Route Fix Documentation

## Problem Summary

The application was experiencing an issue where nothing was being displayed at the root route ('/'), despite having a Home component that should have been rendered there. Interestingly, the console wasn't showing any errors, making this a silent failure.

## Investigation Process

After analyzing the application's routing structure, two key issues were identified:

1. **Incorrect Route Mapping**: The Home component was mapped to the route `/hello` instead of the root path `/` in `sharedRoutes.ts`.

2. **Routing Conflict**: There were two competing routes defined for the same path ('/') in `AllRoutes.tsx`:
    - A protected route that redirected to `authenticatedEntryPath` (also set to '/')
    - A public route section that should contain the Home component

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Route Mapping in sharedRoutes.ts

Changed the path for the Home component from `/hello` to `/` so it would be rendered at the root route:

**Before:**

```typescript
const sharedRoutes: Routes = [
    {
        key: 'homePage',
        path: `/hello`,
        component: lazy(() => import('@/views/Home')) as Route['component'],
        authority: [],
    },
    // ...
]
```

**After:**

```typescript
const sharedRoutes: Routes = [
    {
        key: 'homePage',
        path: `/`,
        component: lazy(() => import('@/views/Home')) as Route['component'],
        authority: [],
    },
    // ...
]
```

### 2. Fixed Route Ordering and Removed Redirect Loop in AllRoutes.tsx

Three important changes were made to the AllRoutes.tsx file:

1. **Changed the order of routes**: Moved public routes before protected routes so the Home component would be processed first
2. **Removed the problematic redirect**: Deleted the redirect that was causing a loop
3. **Removed unused imports**: Cleaned up the code by removing unused imports (`appConfig`)

**Before:**

```typescript
return (
    <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<ProtectedRoute />}>
            <Route
                path="/"
                element={<Navigate replace to={authenticatedEntryPath} />}
            />
            {protectedRoutes.map((route, index) => (
                // ...protected routes...
            ))}
            <Route path="*" element={<Navigate replace to="/" />} />
        </Route>
        <Route path="/" element={<PublicRoute />}>
            {publicRoutes.map((route) => (
                // ...public routes...
            ))}
        </Route>
    </Routes>
)
```

**After:**

```typescript
return (
    <Routes>
        {/* Public routes first to ensure Home component is accessible at root path */}
        <Route path="/" element={<PublicRoute />}>
            {publicRoutes.map((route) => (
                // ...public routes...
            ))}
        </Route>

        {/* Protected routes with paths other than root */}
        <Route path="/" element={<ProtectedRoute />}>
            {protectedRoutes.map((route, index) => (
                // ...protected routes...
            ))}
            <Route path="*" element={<Navigate replace to="/" />} />
        </Route>
    </Routes>
)
```

## Why This Fixes the Issue

1. **Correct Component Mapping**: By changing the path in sharedRoutes.ts from `/hello` to `/`, we ensured the Home component is actually mapped to the root path.

2. **Preventing Redirect Loops**: By reordering the routes and removing the problematic redirect, we avoided the situation where:

    - User visits '/'
    - The protected route was processed first
    - The route attempted to redirect to the same path ('/')
    - This would create either a loop or a blank page

3. **Prioritizing Public Routes**: Moving the public routes to be processed first ensures that your Home component gets priority when matching the root path ('/').

## Technical Analysis

The issue is a common problem in React Router setups where there are competing route definitions. React Router processes routes in the order they are defined, so the first matching route will be used.

In the original configuration:

1. When a user visited '/', React Router would first check the protected routes
2. The first route inside the protected section was a redirect back to '/' (via authenticatedEntryPath)
3. This created a circular reference where the app tried to render a route that redirected to itself
4. The result was either an infinite loop (stopped by the browser) or a blank page with no errors

By changing the route order and removing the problematic redirect, we broke this loop and allowed the Home component to be properly rendered.
