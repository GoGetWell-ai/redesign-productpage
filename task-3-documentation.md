# Task 3: Change Default Path Documentation

## Changes Made

### Modified Configuration in `src/configs/app.config.ts`

Changed the default path configuration from `/hello` to `/` for both authenticated and unauthenticated users:

```typescript
// Previous Configuration:
// authenticatedEntryPath: '/hello'
// unAuthenticatedEntryPath: '/hello'

// Updated Configuration:
authenticatedEntryPath: '/'
unAuthenticatedEntryPath: '/'
```

## Implementation Details

The change was implemented exclusively through the configuration files as required, without modifying any components or application logic.

### How It Works

1. **For Authenticated Users**:

    - When accessing the root path (`/`), the `ProtectedRoute` component allows authenticated users to proceed
    - The route configuration in `AllRoutes.tsx` redirects to `authenticatedEntryPath` (now `/`)
    - React Router detects they're already at the target path and renders the appropriate content without causing redirect loops

2. **For Unauthenticated Users**:
    - When accessing the root path (`/`), the `ProtectedRoute` component redirects them to `unAuthenticatedEntryPath` (now `/`)
    - The `PublicRoute` component sees they're not authenticated and allows them to proceed to the appropriate public page content

## Testing Results

The application now correctly renders the home page at the root path (`/`) for both user types:

1. ✅ **Authenticated users** can access the home page at the root URL
2. ✅ **Unauthenticated users** are properly handled and shown appropriate content at the root URL

## Benefits

-   **Improved URL Structure**: The application now uses a cleaner, more standard URL structure
-   **Better User Experience**: Users have a more intuitive browsing experience with the home page at root
-   **Maintained Separation of Concerns**: The change was implemented solely through configuration without modifying component logic
